# Food Trucks - Final Project for MAC125

You own and operate several food trucks and stands around the city. This program includes a class for each food truck you own, generates a random number to estimate the number of items purchased during an individual transaction (a random number is used to represent sales of a real food truck), tracks the number of items sold each day (also using a random number), and calculates the daily income earned by each of the food trucks you operate. The data is then written to a file so the user can track their business' progress. 

This program demonstrates knowledge of classes, encapsulation, constructors, and input/output streams in C++, among other concepts.
